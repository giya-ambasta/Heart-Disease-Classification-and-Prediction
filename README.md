# Abstract
This repository contains research work on the classification and prediction of heart disease using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The study explores various machine learning algorithms, including recurrent neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), and random forest. After analyzing approximately 45 papers, the ANN algorithm, trained through back-propagation, was selected for model training. The research utilizes the Cleveland hospital heart disease dataset from the UCI machine repository, achieving a high accuracy of 88.5%. The findings suggest that ANN can be a valuable tool for heart disease categorization and prediction.
